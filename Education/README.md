# Education Folder

This folder contains all the research data and tools used in the paper titled **"Use of 3D Photogrammetry Models in Anatomical Education."** The materials here support the findings and methodology described in the study, focusing on the use of 3D models in anatomical education and the analysis of student interactions and feedback.

## Contents

### 1. 3D Anatomy Browser Platform
This folder contains the **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS** files used to create the web-based 3D anatomy browser platform. These files were deployed on **SharePoint** as a secure platform where students could access the 3D models exclusively through their university email accounts. The platform allowed students to view the 3D models in a web browser but restricted any downloading or offline use, as detailed in the paper.

### 2. Questionnaire
The "Questionnaire" folder contains:
- **Data**: The raw data collected from the questionnaire distributed to students, exploring their experiences with the 3D models compared to traditional methods.
- **R Scripts**: Code used for statistical analysis of the questionnaire responses. These scripts include data processing, visualization, and hypothesis testing steps.
- **Generated Plots**: Graphs and visualizations that were directly used in the research paper. These plots highlight the key findings from the questionnaire analysis.
- **Additional Plots**: Further detailed visualizations that provide deeper insights into specific aspects of the questionnaire data. These were not included in the paper but offer a more nuanced view of the results.
