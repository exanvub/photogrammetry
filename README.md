# Photogrammetry

This repository serves as a central hub for the research data collected by the Experimental Anatomy Research Group (EXAN), specifically focusing on the application of photogrammetry in anatomical research and education. The data in this repository is organized into distinct folders based on the specific research projects.

## Contents

### 1. Bone
This folder contains all the research data associated with the paper titled **"Reliable and Efficient Photogrammetry in Anatomical Research and Education."** The data within this folder focuses on the application of photogrammetry techniques in capturing and analyzing bone structures.

### 2. Education
This folder contains the research data used in the paper titled **"Use of 3D Photogrammetry Models in Anatomical Education."** The data is centered around the use of 3D photogrammetry models in the educational context, examining student interaction with these models in anatomy courses.

### 3. Blender_Addons
A collection of Blender add-ons designed for working with photogrammetry models in anatomical research. 
Includes **Landmark Registration** (`blender_landmarks.py`) for placing, tracking, renaming, and exporting anatomical landmarks on 3D meshes, and **3D Model Scaling** (`blender_scaling.py`) for scaling photogrammetry models to real-world dimensions.

### 4. Dissection_Validation
This folder contains the analysis scripts and data for validating photogrammetry models of dissected human donor material against CT reference meshes and visual inspection scores. It includes **CT Analysis** (`CT_Analysis.py`) for comparing vertex distances between photogrammetry models and reference CT meshes, and **Visual Inspection VAS Analysis** (`visual_analysis.py`) for statistical analysis of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scoring data from researchers evaluating photogrammetry models across multiple quality topics.
